## Template for projects

1. Please write a question you would like to answer with your project.
2. Please write a one-sentence description of the impact of your project.



Some examples of good questions:

1. *"Why are password manager users not using the feature of creating random passwords?"* This question can be answered with either a semi-structured interview or a survey to password manager users.
2. *"What privacy concerns do people raise for not adopting IoT home devices?"* This is an exploratory study (assuming you don't know much about people's concerns), which may be conducted either as field study, focus groups, or interviews.
3. *"How do lay users keep their privacy in social network XYZ?"* This question assumes you have heard or read about privacy concerns people have about such social network, or about a similar one which has been studied in deep.
4. *"Are users of system XYZ able to understand and comply with the security messages that the system displays when this and that happens?"* This question assumes that in system XYZ there are some important security decisions that are left to the user to make, and that you believe the information presented may not be effective to make such decisions.



Some examples of sentences that describe the impact of a project trying to answer the questions above:

1. *"The answer could help us understand how we can help users create stronger unique passwords for their online accounts."*
2. *"This may be important both to design better IoT home devices, and to better cope with users' growing privacy concerns."*
3. *"Understanding what do lay users do could be important to redesign privacy controls for social networks."*
4. *"It's critical that users are actually able to make security decisions with system XYZ knowing what is at stake, as current security messages may not conveying enough or understandable information for the user to decide."*



Some examples of bad questions:

1. *"How many users are able to login using authentication scheme XYZ?"*: The answer of this question may or may not teach you something about why such authentication scheme is or is not usable, or whether it's better or worse than any other existing authentication scheme. A better question could be: *"Is XYZ more usable than ABC?"*. In this case, you would have to define what exactly do you mean by "more usable" (do they take less time to login? do they commit fewer errors? etc.)
