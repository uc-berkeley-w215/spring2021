# MICS W215 Midterm Exam (TEMPLATE)

## Instructions

### Logistics

You may ask the course staff questions privately during the exam, but otherwise may not use any human assistance. You may use your book and readings as a reference, as well as web-based reference materials (e.g., Wikipedia, Berkeley Library resources) during this exam. However, if you do, please cite the materials you used (e.g. Textbook sections 8.6.7 & 5.3.0.9, or the URL of a web-based resource) in your answer.  Not humans or AIs though.

If you take this exam by copying the Google Doc, you may *optionally* share your work in progress with the instructors (imposter@berkeley.edu and cbravolillo@berkeley.edu).  If you do, we will watch to see if there are any common points of confusion that may warrant clarification to the class. This will also save you from worrying about the time required to submit the final PDF to the learning management system (ISVC), as the Google Doc's document history will show if you stopped working at the end of class. If you are not sharing the Google Doc, you will need to ensure you've submitted the exam before time expires.

If you decide to make a non-shared copy of the exam, *please make sure to copy all of the questions*. There will be blank space both between questions and between sections for formatting purposes; be mindful of the full extent of the exam before starting.

### Instructions pertaining to the whole exam

Since ethics, like security, is both critical but often a secondary task, we may put ethical issues in questions that do not say they are about ethics. See prior exams for examples, where we asked about problems with studies which had obvious ethical issues without saying we were looking for ethics issues.  If an ethical issue is among problems or limitations you might be asked to identify in a study, the ethics issue is required even if that question is worded generally.

If we ask for `n` items (e.g. reasons why a study is flawed) and you can think of more than `n`, you may provide more than `n`.  If `n` of your answers are valid, and the others are not unreasonable (e.g. you're not just throwing all plausible answers out there not knowing if each one is right or wrong) we'll give you full credit.

Make sure to read questions carefully.  If the questions about a hypothetical research study asserts that *"researchers claim `X`is true''*, then `X` may or may not be true.  If the question states that `X` is true, then we are asking you to assume that `X` is indeed true.

Similarly, If we give you a scenario and ask you for problems with it, the problems should be identifiable from the question and not a matter of speculation about details we didn't bother to provide.
